                    <li>Gamers can get game recommendation predicted by AI according to their gaming history 
                and get sales for indie games that are sponsored by WeGame.co. Users get bonus points 
                for playing games sponsored by us. Each bonus points equals some amount of money so 
                gamers can earn money just by playing games. Prizes will be supported by our foundation.</li>
                <li>Developers can advertise their games on our platform and test their betas with users. 
                    The games that are sponsored by us will earn many users and more money. 
                    And they'll pay a little part of the money that they earned from our website back to us 
                    after reaching per milestone. Foundation will be supported by joining fee and 
                    the money that comes from sponsors.</li>

                    The main mission is to make a web app that all the gamers or game developers can use according to 
                    their puposes. Game developers will be able to connect to the gamers and get feedback and reviews. 
                    We aim to help indie game developers through brand new digital platform. With this platform, gamers 
                    will be able to get game recommendations and gaming tips by AI used system. Other than that we have 
                    community of gamers that will help gamer users to enjoy their time. Also, we are planning to support 
                    indie game development studios that are advertised by us will have a chance to increase user count or 
                    get many users via advertisement. After they reach per milestone (according to money that they earned 
                    and users count) they will pay us some money. most part of this money will be spent on prizes for gamers. 
                    Our project WeGame is entirely created for that.
