            <div class="accordion-body">WeGame is a web app that help gamers  and game developers in many aspects: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Gamers can get game recommendations predicted by AI according to their gaming history from different gaming platforms
                and try new indie games that are available on WeGame.co. Users get bonus points 
                based on their activity, while playing games and leaving reviews; Each bonus points equals some amount of money; Thus
                the more active a user is on the platform, the more money they can earn.
                Prizes for outstanding users will be available and supported by our foundation.</li>
                <li>Testing and getting feedback for games is essential, especilly while they still are in development.
                Unfortunatly, this is can be a big problem for indie developers who might not have the resources
                to hire hundreds or thousands of players to test their games before their release. On our platforrm, developers can 
                get feedback and reviews from a community of gamers during production. 
                The developers who register their games our platform will get the opportunity to grow
                a fan base before release and test their "still-in-development" games for a very small fee. This
                money will then go back to the gamers on the platform. After developers reach a milestone (according to money that they earned 
                and users count) they will pay us some money, most part of this money will be spent on prizes for gamers.

                    The main mission is to make a web app that all the gamers or game developers can use according to 
                    their puposes. Game developers will be able to connect to the gamers and get feedback and reviews
                    for creating a better game, and thus increasing their future earnings for that game. 
                    We aim to help indie game developers through a brand new digital platform. With this platform, gamers 
                    will be able to get recommendations for new games on our platform and enjoy playing them, while earning
                    money on the side. Other than that, we have community of gamers that will help users enjoy their time. 
                    As our platform grows, we plan to make improvements to our recommendation engine by making it more
                    sophisticated. We are going to implement more complicated measures to protect users' privacy and
                    avoid spams. We will feature indie developers that get alot of players and positive reviews on our platform.
                    In short, our main mission is to help indie developers create better games, more confidently, and to 
                    help gamers earn money while playing and finding new games.

                    to their friends. As we calculated during the next 5 months (months 4-9) we can get more than 3.5 mln users.</p>
                    <p>Second: We have a plan for getting much more people using this app. People who use this app will be able to 
                    get prizes such as gift cards, equipments(for developers) etc. by using and sharing our app. All the people 
                    who share that will join a giveaway. With that, more people will hear about it and it will become more popular.
                    As more users get on the platform, we will change and adapt the platform according to their needs,
                    in order to create a flawless user experience.</p>
